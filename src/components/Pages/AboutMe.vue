          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Originally from Edinburgh, I recently relocated to Vancouver.</p>
          <p>
            I am constantly challenging myself to get better at what I do. I
            currently work as a front-end designer but I'm keen to broaden my
            horizons.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not designing, you'll find me in the mountains, on a
            climbing wall, or playing guitar.
